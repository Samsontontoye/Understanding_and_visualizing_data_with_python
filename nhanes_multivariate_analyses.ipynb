    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we illustrate several basic techniques for exploring data using methods for understanding multivariate relationships.  The statistical methods discussed here will parallel the methods discussed in the multivariate methods section of the course, and build on the univariate analysis discussed earlier.  As with the univariate notebook, we use here the 2015-2016 wave of the [NHANES](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.htm) study for illustration.\n",

    "Many of the analyses presented in this notebook use the Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries for data visualization.  These are very powerful tools that give you a vast number of options when constructing plots.  We will not explain every option to every function in the examples below. You can use the [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/users/index.html) and [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial.html) documentation to fully understand the options, and you can experiment with these and other plots on your own to get a better sense of what can be done.

    "Bivariate data arise when every \"unit of analysis\" (e.g. a person in the NHANES dataset) is assessed with respect to two traits (the NHANES subjects were assessed for many more than two traits, but we can consider two traits at a time here).  \n",

    "A scatterplot is a very common and easily-understood visualization of quantitative bivariate data.  Below we make a scatterplot of arm length against leg length.  This means that arm length ([BMXARML](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2015-2016/BMX_I.htm#BMXARML)) is plotted on the vertical axis and leg length ([BMXLEG](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2015-2016/BMX_I.htm#BMXLEG)) is plotted on the horizontal axis).  We see a positive dependence between the two measures -- people with longer arms tend to have longer legs, and vice-versa.  However it is far from a perfect relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a scatterplot with more than around 100 points, \"overplotting\" becomes an issue.  This means that many points fall on top of each other in the plot, which obscures relationships in the middle of the distribution and over-emphasizes the extremes.  One way to mitigate overplotting is to use an \"alpha\" channel to make the points semi-transparent, as we have done below."

For example, it is unlikely for young people to be widowed, and it is less likely for older people to be \"never married\", since a person can transition from \"never married\" into one of the other categories, but can never move back.  Below we will consider the role of age in more detail, and later in the course we will revisit these questions using more sophisticated analytic methods that can account for all of these factors simultaneously.  However, since NHANES is a cross-sectional study, there are certain important questions that it cannot be used to answer.  For example, while we know each person's current marital status, we do not know their full marital history (e.g. how many times and at what ages they were married or divorced)."
